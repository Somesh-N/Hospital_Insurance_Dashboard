# Hospital & Insurance Performance Insights â€” Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital and insurance performance metrics .
As a final-year engineering student Intereted in data Engineering , I developed this project to demonstrate my ability to Handle raw data with SQL & Transform into actionable insights using Power BI Without Using Any Of The Pre-Defined Templates or Themes.


## Objectives

- Visualize key performance indicators for hospitals and insurance providers
- Analyze treatment cost variations by age, gender, region, and insurance type
- Track patient admission trends and average Bill trends over the years 
- Compare claim ratios across major insurance providers
- Apply advanced Power BI techniques for layout, filtering, and interactivity

### Real-World Applications from Dashboard Patterns
- Helps patients identify insurance providers with high claim failure rates before choosing coverage.
- Enables insurers to monitor gender-wise disease distribution and launch targeted wellness campaigns.
- Tracks billing trends over time to support hospital revenue forecasting and budget planning.
- Analyzes average treatment and result times to improve diagnostic turnaround and service quality.
- Reveals age-wise claim rejection patterns across providers to guide smarter insurance decisions for customers.

## Technical Implementation

- Tool: Power BI Desktop  
- File Format: `.pbix`  
- Techniques Used:
  -imported Dataset & converted intoo CSV file.
  - Used Pandas & Matplotlib Libraries for Handling Data & Initial Visualization
  - MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE To Normalise & Cleaning The Data
  - mysql-connector-python TO connect Python & SQL 
  - DAX for calculated columns and measures
  - Used visualisation and Data Fields  For The optimization
  -  Handled Cross-filtering and drill-through functions
  - GitHub Desktop & GitBash For The Repo
