# Hospital & Insurance Performance Insights â€” Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a detailed Power BI dashboard analyzing hospital and insurance performance metrics .
As a final-year engineering student specializing in data Engineering , I developed this project to demonstrate my ability to Handle raw data with SQL & Transform into actionable insights using Power BI.


## Objectives

- Visualize key performance indicators for hospitals and insurance providers
- Analyze treatment cost variations by age, gender, region, and insurance type
- Track patient admission trends and average Bill trends over the years 
- Compare claim ratios across major insurance providers
- Apply advanced Power BI techniques for layout, filtering, and interactivity
